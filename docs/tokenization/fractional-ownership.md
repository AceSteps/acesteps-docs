# Fractional Ownership

How fractional ownership works on AceSteps.

## What is Fractional Ownership?

Instead of one person owning 100% of a song, ownership is split among many token holders.

## Ownership Math

| Tokens Held | Ownership % | Example Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 100,000 | 100% | $1,000 |
| 50,000 | 50% | $500 |
| 10,000 | 10% | $100 |
| 1,000 | 1% | $10 |
| 100 | 0.1% | $1 |
| 1 | 0.001% | $0.01 |

## Benefits

### For Creators

- **Liquidity** - Convert ownership to cash
- **Retain Control** - Keep 80% initially
- **Aligned Incentives** - Success benefits all

### For Fans/Investors

- **Access** - Own part of music you love
- **Upside** - Benefit from success
- **Liquidity** - Trade anytime on Uniswap

## How It Works

### Before Tokenization

```
Creator owns: 1 NFT (100%)
Others own: 0%
```

### After Tokenization

```
NFT: Locked in vault

Creator owns: 80,000 tokens (80%)
Pool has: 20,000 tokens (20%)
```

### After Trading

```
Creator sells: 30,000 tokens
Creator owns: 50,000 tokens (50%)
Investor A owns: 20,000 tokens (20%)
Investor B owns: 10,000 tokens (10%)
Pool has: 20,000 tokens (20%)
```

## Revenue Rights

Token holders benefit from revenue via pool appreciation:

1. Ad revenue collected
2. 80% donated to Uniswap pool
3. Token price increases
4. All holders benefit proportionally
