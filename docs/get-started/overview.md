# Overview

Welcome to **AceSteps** - the AI-powered music creation and tokenization platform built on Base Network.

## What is AceSteps?

AceSteps is a Farcaster Mini App that enables anyone to create, own, and earn from music. The platform solves the music industry's biggest challenges:

### The Problem

**For Creators:**
- Traditional music industry has high barriers to entry
- Record labels take 80-90% of revenue
- Artists need expensive equipment, studios, and years of training
- No direct connection with fans for investment/support

**For Fans:**
- No way to directly invest in favorite artists
- No ownership stake in music they love
- Cannot participate in an artist's success story

### The Solution

AceSteps provides a three-pillar solution:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Music Creation** | Anyone can create professional-quality music using text prompts - no musical training required |
| **NFT Ownership** | Every song is minted as an ERC-721 NFT - creator owns 100% of the copyright |
| **Fractional Investment** | Songs can be tokenized into 100,000 ERC-20 tokens for fan investment |
