# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about AceSteps.

## General

### What is AceSteps?

AceSteps is an AI-powered music creation and tokenization platform. Create music with text prompts, mint as NFTs, and trade fractional ownership tokens.

### What network is AceSteps on?

AceSteps is built on **Base Network** (chainId: 8453), an Ethereum L2 by Coinbase.

### Do I need crypto to use AceSteps?

Yes, you need a small amount of ETH on Base for gas fees. Creating music is free, but minting NFTs requires gas.

## Music Creation

### How does AI music generation work?

You enter a text prompt describing the music you want. Our ACE-Step AI model generates unique audio based on your description.

### Can I request specific songs or artists?

No. The AI generates original music and does not reproduce copyrighted material.

### How long are generated songs?

Songs are typically 30-60 seconds. Duration options may expand in the future.

## NFTs & Tokens

### What happens when I "Save" a song?

Saving mints an ERC-721 NFT to your wallet. You own the original song.

### What does "Enable Trading" do?

Enabling trading:

1. Locks your NFT permanently
2. Creates 100,000 ERC-20 tokens
3. Gives you 80,000 tokens
4. Adds 20,000 to Uniswap pool

### Can I get my NFT back after enabling trading?

No. The NFT is permanently locked. This prevents rug pulls and ensures token value.

### Why 100,000 tokens per song?

This provides granular ownership while maintaining meaningful token amounts. Each token represents 0.001% of the song.

## Revenue

### How do I earn from my songs?

Two ways:

1. **Non-tokenized**: 80% of ad revenue paid directly to NFT owner
2. **Tokenized**: 80% of ad revenue increases token value via `donate()`

### How often is revenue distributed?

Revenue is distributed regularly (details TBD). For tokenized songs, it's added to the pool automatically.

## Technical

### What wallet should I use?

Any Ethereum-compatible wallet works. Connection happens through Farcaster's built-in wallet connector.

### Are the smart contracts audited?
