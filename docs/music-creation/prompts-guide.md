# Prompts Guide

Learn how to write effective prompts for better music generation.

## Prompt Structure

A good prompt includes:

1. **Genre/Style** - The type of music
2. **Mood/Energy** - The emotional feel
3. **Instruments** - Specific sounds you want
4. **Tempo** (optional) - Speed of the track

## Examples

### Lo-fi

```
chill lofi beat with soft piano, vinyl crackle, and rain sounds
```

### Electronic

```
energetic EDM track with heavy bass drops and synth arpeggios
```

### Hip-hop

```
dark trap beat with 808 bass, hi-hats, and atmospheric pads
```

### Ambient

```
peaceful ambient soundscape with nature sounds and gentle strings
```

## Tips

- Be specific but not overly complex
- Include 3-5 descriptive elements
- Mention tempo if important (e.g., "slow", "upbeat")
- Reference moods (e.g., "melancholic", "euphoric")

## What to Avoid

- Copyrighted song/artist references
- Overly long prompts (keep under 100 words)
- Contradicting descriptions
