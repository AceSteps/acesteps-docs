# Claiming Earnings

How to convert token value appreciation into realized gains.

## For Token Holders

### Realizing Gains

Token holders benefit from price appreciation. To realize gains:

1. Go to your Portfolio
2. Select the song token
3. Click "Sell"
4. Enter amount to sell
5. Confirm transaction
6. Receive ETH

### Example

```
You bought: 1,000 tokens @ 0.0001 ETH each = 0.1 ETH
Current price: 0.00015 ETH each
Value: 0.15 ETH (+50%)

Sell 500 tokens:
- Receive: ~0.075 ETH
- Keep: 500 tokens worth ~0.075 ETH
```

## For Creators

### Selling Initial Tokens

As creator with 80,000 tokens:

1. Decide how much to sell
2. Consider market impact
3. Sell in smaller batches
4. Retain some for long-term

### Best Practices

- **Don't dump** - Large sells crash price
- **Gradual selling** - Spread over time
- **Communication** - Tell community your plans
- **Retain stake** - Keep skin in the game

## For NFT Owners (Non-Tokenized)

If your song isn't tokenized:

1. Revenue paid directly to wallet
2. Check "Earnings" section
3. Claim when available
